### Writing styles that read clearly is tricky:

```
a button
  has 6px padding
  has standard border radius
  is blue by default
  is red in primary state
  is green in success state

the header contains buttons spaced 10px apart
```

> Does this resemble the way your designer describes a mock-up?
